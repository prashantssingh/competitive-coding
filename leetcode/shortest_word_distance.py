# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these
#  two words in the list.
# 
# EXAMPLE:
# Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
# 
# INPUT:                                                            OUTPUT:
# word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”                              3
# 
# INPUT:                                                            OUTPUT:
# word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"                                 1
# 
# NOTE:
# You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
