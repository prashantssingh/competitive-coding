# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
# compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

# LINK: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/
# ELEVALTION: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. 
# In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

# EXAMPLE:

# INPUT:                                                   OUTPUT:
# [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]                                6
