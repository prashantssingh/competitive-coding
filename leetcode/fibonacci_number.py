# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
# such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
# F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
# F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
# Given N, calculate F(N).

# EXAMPLES:
# INPUT:                                               OUTPUT:
# 2                                                    1
# EXPLANATION: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

# INPUT:                                               OUTPUT:
# 3                                                    2
# EXPLANATION: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

# INPUT:                                               OUTPUT:
# 4                                                    3
# EXPLANATION: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
 

# NOTE: 0 ≤ N ≤ 30.
