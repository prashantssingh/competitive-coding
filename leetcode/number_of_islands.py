# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is 
# surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You 
# may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

# EXAMPLE 1:
# INPUT                                      OUTPUT:
# 11110                                      1
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000


# EXAMPLE 2:
# INPUT                                      OUTPUT:
# 11000                                       3
# 11000
# 00100
# 00011
