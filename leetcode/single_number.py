# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# 
# NOTE:
# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
# 
# EXAMPLE:
# INPUT:                                    OUTPUT:
# [2,2,1]                                   1
# 
# INPUT:                                    OUTPUT:
# [4,1,2,1,2]                               4
