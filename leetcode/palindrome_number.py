# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the
# same backward as forward.

# EXAMPLE:
# INPUT                                             OUTPUT
# 121                                               true

# INPUT                                             OUTPUT
# -121                                              false
# EXPLANATION: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. 
# Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# INPUT                                             OUTPUT
# 10                                                false
# Input: -121
# Output: false
# EXPLANATION: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
