# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
# 
# EXAMPLE:
# INPUT:                                    OUTPUT:
# nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2               [1,2]
# 
# INPUT:                                    OUTPUT:
# nums = [1], k = 1                         [1]
# 
# NOTE:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
# Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
