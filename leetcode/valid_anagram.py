#  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
# 
# EXAMPLES:
# INPUT                                               OUTPUT:
# s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"                        true
# 
# EXAMPLES:
# INPUT                                               OUTPUT:
# s = "rat", t = "car"                                false
# 
# NOTE:
# You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
# 
# FOLLOW UP:
# What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
