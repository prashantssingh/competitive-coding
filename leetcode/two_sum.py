# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# EXAMPLE:
# INPUT
# Nums: [2, 7, 11, 15], target: 9,

# EXPLANATION:
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].
